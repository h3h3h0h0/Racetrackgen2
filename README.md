# Racetrackgen2
The first racetrack generator is not working due to API issues. This one will do it completely procedurally instead of using GIS data.

# Generation Method
The model will combine a noise map with randomized points to generate a basic, angular route. Then, smoothing will be applied to achieve the finished racetrack.
